The amazing (natural) castrato Radu Marian, a  widely respected and very popular singer, has sung soprano since he was a small boy.  His voice never changed.  He is a natural soprano who sings to a clear and exciting C natural.  His naturally nigh voice is the result of  a medical condition.  He has worked hard  on his voice and is a recognized and excellent musician.  His is no circus act and never has been. He deserves great respect for the way he has handled his astonishing gift.  I know virtually all I know about high voiced male singers to Dr. Stephen Westmoreland, who is responsible for virtually all the videos  which appear on Youtube relating to very high voiced male singers. This is an astonishing recording.  Radu is 7 here, recording in Moscow, and singing in French.  I looked around as best I could to find a decent picture of Radu as a child.  I hope I have not made a mistake.  I have been known to do so!!
