The infamous final boss of Hanon's exercises. A true finger- and wrist-breaker.

Thanks for listening!

About the work:
Charles-Louis Hanon (1819-1900) was a French piano pedagogue and composer. He is best known for his work The Virtuoso Pianist in 60 Exercises.

The Virtuoso Pianist (Le Pianiste virtuose) is a compilation of sixty exercises meant to train the pianist in speed, precision, agility, and strength of all of the fingers and flexibility in the wrists. First published in Boulogne, in 1873, The Virtuoso Pianist is still widely used by piano instructors and pupils. However, the applicability of these nineteenth-century exercises has been questioned by some piano instructors today.
