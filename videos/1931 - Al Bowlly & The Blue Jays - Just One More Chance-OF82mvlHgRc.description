The Blue Jays (Harry Hudson’s Orchestra) – Just One More Chance (Johnston – Coslow) Fox-Trot with Vocal chorus (by Al Bowlly) Edison Bell Radio 1931 (UK)

NOTE: Harry HUDSON (1898-1969) - British pianist and in-house band leader for Edison Bell (the label was on market between 1929-33). Hudson’s band recorded under various names, including Harry Hudson’s Melody Men, The Blue Jays, Radio Rhythm Boys, Paramount Rhythm Boys or Murray’s Melody Men as the most prevalent. Harry Hudson used a whole of excellent musicians: Murray Dempsey and Sylvester Ahola (trumpets); Ben Oakley (trombone); Sid Phillips, George Melachrino (clarinets) Annunzio Mantovani (violin) and vocalists such as Al Bowlly (who  recorded several sessions in Sept 1930),  Les Allen, Elsie Carlisle, Sam Browne, just to name a few. Edison Bell Radio, where Harry Hudson recorded most of his sides, was swallowed in 1933 by Decca and the label disappeared together with Harry Hudson’s orchestra (his last recording was made in 1934). From late 1930s to 1950s Harry Hudson was still performing as pianist; from 1947 he was a popular performer on Britain's first radio quiz Have A Go.
